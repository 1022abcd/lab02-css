# CSS Lab - Dawg Coffee
For this lab you will be taking an existing website with some broken CSS and fixing it. To do so, you will be given screenshots of a working version of the site. You will have to figure out how to achieve those results using your knowledge of CSS. We aren't expecting pixel perfect for this nor are you turning this in, only for you to use and learn about new css selectors

## List of some things you may not notice
* The rounded corner class should actually round corners (see story image)
* Header image should fill the screen (no tiles)
* Background of "Story" block should fill to the bottom of the story image (See screenshot)
* Top of the footer should have a small orange border
* Links in the cafe section should be orange on hover
* Spacing on the SVG's should be closer to the content below it in the middle section (hours, map, contact)
* Remember to check to see if any rules are more specific and are overwriting your rule

### Note -
You shouldn't be chaning *any* HTML for this lab! Every change should be CSS only.
