# CSS Lab - Dawg Coffee
For this lab you will be taking an existing website with some broken CSS and fixing it. To do so, you will be given screenshots of a working version of the site. You will have to figure out how to achieve those results using your knowledge of CSS.

## List of some things you may not notice
* The rounded corner class should actually round corners
* Header image should fill the screen
* Background of "Story" block should fill to the bottom of the story image (See screenshot)
* Top of the footer should have a small orange border
* Links in the cafe section should be orange on hover

### Note -
You shouldn't be chaning *any* HTML for this lab! Every change should be CSS only.
